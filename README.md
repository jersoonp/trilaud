# trilaud
Gifted sub farmer for Twitch TriHard :handshake: VisLaud
## Features ##
* Synchronous channel join, respects the [recently enforced ratelimits](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide#authentication-and-join-rate-limits). Join more than 20 channels without issues.
* Optional: play a sound when you get a gift
* Optional: monitor pings (mentions), play a sound in addition if enabled
* Add new channels without restarting. Just add the new channels to channels.txt and send the program a SIGUSR2 or use the integrated web server to send a reload command (Windows users must use the later as Windows doesn't support SIGUSR1-2)
* [Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) under the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). Bug reports and feature requests are welcome.
* Designed for unattended use. Set it up and forget about it (kinda Okayeg)
* No need to register a dedicated Twitch application for it
* Should run just fine on Windows, OSX and GNU/Linux. On Free and Dragonfly BSD you'll need the alsa utils compatibility package to hear sounds
* Shoult run on other platforms supported by node.js, but without sound playback for now.
* No architecture specifc code I know of. You can run it on your Raspberry PI 24/7! (this is how I use it akshually ðŸ¤“)

## What does this do? ##
This simple nodejs program joins a bunch of Twitch channels for ya, so you can yoink gifted subs and event emotes WideHardo
## What doesn't this program do ##
It will not say anything under your name. You are just another name in the viewer list that nobody checks anyway pepeLaugh
## Why does it join channels so slow? forsenY ##
[Twitch limits the rate of how many channels you can join under a given time](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide#authentication-and-join-rate-limits). 
For non-"verified bot" accounts this is 20 channel joins per 10 seconds. The program joins one channel once per at least 580ms, a safe value (roughly 17 joins per 10 seconds). 
From my experience with twitch ratelimits it's best to play safe. To reduce the impact of this (as also mentioned) you can add more channels without restarting. 
Just add the new channels to channels.txt and send SIGUSR2 to the program or use the web interface to start a reload.

## How to use? FeelsDankMan ##
1. Download or clone the repo **As the program is under constant, daily development I suggest you clone and update it regularly**
2. Copy config.js.example to config.js
3. Open config.js in a text editor and fill out the config. Instruction are inside
4. create a file called "channels.txt" and fill it with channels you want to be in, one channel per line. Empty and too short lines are ignored
5. Download and install node.js. I develop it on Node 12.xLTS and run it on 10.xLTS, so I recommend using 12.xLTS if you don't use it otherwise
6. Run npm install in the project's folder to install the required modules
7. Run the program with "node triLaud.js"
8. optional: Install the pm2 process manager (https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) and run the program with "pm2 triLaud.js". pm2 will automatically restart it on case of crashes and errors I can only handle with terminating the application
9. On updates: check the console or config.js.example for added new options that require setup
## http interface ##
triLaud has an integrated web server (nodejs http server base, no additional bloat) for stats and reload option for Windows users. 
If you don't need/don't want this functionality set http port to 0 in the config (or remove the setting).

Endpoints:
* / : stats in html
* / : issue a reload command, reply in html
* /api/reload : issue a realod command, reply in JSON

Planned:
* /api/stats : stats in JSON

## Changelog ##
* **2021-08-16** Added donk stats pages (WIP, planned features: better looks, options to order then)
* **2021-08-14** Now counts gifts detected per session, added stats to web interface. Added high quality OC favicon.
* **2021-08-13** Added httpHost variable so integrated server can listen on network.
* **2021-08-12** Added a JSON endpoint (/api/reload) to http server, because we need JSON API in gifted sub farmer NaM
* **2021-08-12** v0.1.2 - PagMan new option and function: http server. Add the new httpPort variable to config then navigate to http://localhost:*port* for a supa simple page for channel stats and reload option for Winfriends. More stats coming soon!
* **2021-08-12** v0.1.1 - Changed reload signal for Unix like OS' from USR1 to USR2, as USR1 is reserved (kinda) by node for the debugger and listening to it may cause issues when ran with the debugger.
* **2021-08-09** New option: colorful output. New dependency: [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) Report JoinError's only at one place.
* **2021-08-09** Started tracking changes FeelsOkayMan. Version 0.0.1 -> 0.1.1
